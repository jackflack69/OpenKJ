Thomas Issac Lightburn passed away in his sleep on February 6th 2022.

I knew Issac personally for several years, but really hadn't spoken to him since I moved away from Nashville in 2019.

I do know that continued development, updates, and support for OpenKJ a cross platform Karaoke player will not be continued by the original author.

Also his back-end database called Songbook @ https://okjsongbook.com/ will not be continued by the original author.

Also the iOS and Android applications created to access Songbook will not be continued by the orginal author.

The announcement of his death is verifiable from the funeral home his family used to say goodbye to Isaac. The link is below.

I am sending this to the contributors listed on the github contributions page so if they were curious why Issac hadn't contacted them, this is why.

I am sorry for your loss as well. He had an amazing mind, paid attention to the little details, and created a truly great gift to the Karaoke Community.

If anyone would like to continue his little side project OpenKJ, I would love to know. It would be an amazing tribute to see OpenKJ live on even after Issacs untimely passing.

I personally have no access to any of Issacs coding, projects, or accounts. I am not looking for them either. I am not a programmer or coder, just a fan.

Thank you for your time. 

David W.
